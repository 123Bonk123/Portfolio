# Old WinForms Projects 2014

This folder contains simple WinForms projects that I made in 2014 while studying programming at the Novosibirsk Academy of Design and Programming.

Each project contains a shortcut that you can use to launch it. You can also go to the "bin" folder and launch the exe-file directly.
